JetFuelExpress
==============

Bit.ly clone built with Backbone, Express.js, and MongoDB.

This is my first attempt at writing an app only in JavaScript.

It's based on the Jumpstart Lab [JetFuel Project](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/jet_fuel.html),
originally specified to be built in Ruby with Sinatra.
